/*
 * iOS3-VM — S5L8900 NAND flash device.
 *
 * NAND holds the root filesystem, so it is what M4/M5 ultimately need. This
 * header models the *device*: geometry, page reads and writes, block erase,
 * and per-page spare (OOB) bytes. That part is well understood and testable.
 *
 * SCOPE, STATED HONESTLY: sitting above the raw device on a real iPhone are
 * Apple's VFL (virtual flash layer) and FTL (flash translation layer), which
 * map logical pages to physical ones, handle wear levelling, bad blocks and
 * write journalling. Those layers are a substantial reverse-engineering job in
 * their own right and cannot be faithfully implemented without validating
 * against real firmware behaviour. This file deliberately does NOT guess at
 * them. It provides the raw device the FTL will sit on, plus a trivial
 * identity mapping useful for tests and for loading a prepared image.
 *
 * Attempting a plausible-looking FTL that has never been checked against real
 * data would be worse than having none: it would pass our tests and fail
 * silently on a genuine NAND dump.
