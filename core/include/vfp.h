/*
 * iOS3-VM — VFPv2 (VFP11) coprocessor, public interface.
 *
 * The ARM1176JZF-S carries a VFP11 unit implementing VFPv2: 32 single-precision
 * registers s0-s31 aliased onto 16 double-precision registers d0-d15. There is
 * no d16-d31 and there is no Advanced SIMD/NEON on this part.
 *
 * Everything about WHY this exists, and every floating-point semantic this
 * implementation does and does not model, is documented at the top of
 * core/src/arm/vfp.c. Read that before using anything here.
