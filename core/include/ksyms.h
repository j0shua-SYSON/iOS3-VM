/*
 * iOS3-VM — PC-to-symbol resolution for the XNU kernelcache.
 *
 * A wedged boot reports a hot PC. Without this, that PC is a bare hex number,
 * and every diagnosis cycle starts by working out by hand which kext owns it —
 * a cost we have paid four times over (ADMFMC, MBX, IORTC, ...). This module
 * turns an address into a name, from the two sources a 3.x kernelcache carries:
 *
 *   1. LC_SYMTAB — the kernel's own nlist table. xnu is NOT stripped in this
 *      build (11430 N_SECT symbols), so every address inside the kernel proper
 *      resolves to "_symbol+0x12".
 *
 *   2. __PRELINK_INFO — an XML plist array of one dict per prelinked kext.
 *      MEASURED against iPhone1,2 7E18 (xnu-1357.5.30): the keys that matter
 *      are CFBundleIdentifier, _PrelinkExecutable (load address) and
 *      _PrelinkExecutableSize. Note the names: this era has NO
 *      _PrelinkExecutableLoadAddr — that spelling arrives later — which is
 *      exactly why the parser refuses to guess and reports what it did find.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT AVAILABLE, STATED: the prelinked kexts carry no symbol table.
 * Each one is a real MH_KEXT_BUNDLE Mach-O inside __PRELINK_TEXT, but its load
 * commands are only __TEXT, __DATA and LC_UUID — the kernelcache builder
 * stripped LC_SYMTAB. So a kext address resolves to "<bundle-id>+0xNNNN" and
 * cannot resolve further. If a future image does carry per-kext symbols, the
 * hook is kext_t.addr/size plus a per-kext table in ksyms_resolve().
 *
 * Symbol NAMES point into the caller's image buffer and are not copied; the
 * image must outlive the ksyms_t.
