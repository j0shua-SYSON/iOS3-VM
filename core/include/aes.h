/*
 * iOS3-VM — AES (128/192/256) with CBC mode.
 *
 * Apple encrypts the DATA payload of 3.x-era IMG3 images with AES-CBC, so
 * decryption sits between us and running real firmware. The keys and IVs for
 * 3.x devices are published by the reverse-engineering community; the user
 * supplies them (we ship none).
 *
 * This is a compact, self-contained implementation so the core keeps its
 * zero-dependency property — no OpenSSL, nothing to cross-compile for iOS.
 * It is validated against the FIPS-197 known-answer vectors.
 *
 * NOTE: this implementation is written for correctness and portability, not to
 * resist side-channel attacks. It decrypts publicly-known firmware keys on the
 * user's own device; it is not suitable for protecting secrets.
