 * and what it expects of them.
 *
 *   _s5l8900x_get_timebase    reads 0x080/0x084 as a free-running 64-bit
 *                             counter. This is mach_absolute_time(). It must
 *                             count whether or not any timer is "enabled", or
 *                             every delay loop in the kernel spins forever.
 *   _pe_arm_init_interrupts   programs timer 4 at 0x0A0-0x0AF and then routes
 *                             VIC line 7 to *FIQ*, not IRQ.
 *   _s5l8900x_set_decrementer writes the next deadline to 0x0A8.
 *   _fleh_fiq_s5l8900x        acknowledges by writing 0x00030000 to the latch.
 *
 * That acknowledge mask is load-bearing. Latching any other bit pattern leaves
 * the line asserted after the handler returns, which produces an interrupt
 * storm rather than a scheduler tick.
 *
 * The status alias at 0x10000 sits outside the usual 4 KB peripheral window,
 * which is why the timer's window is widened (see S5L8900_TIMER_SIZE).

 * polling a status bit that reads 0 forever spun on one such window for
 * 3.9 million reads, about 2% of an entire boot.
 *

 * return what was last written, writes are recorded, and every window is named
 * and counted so it appears in the report instead of hiding. What a stub must
 * never do is fabricate a value the guest is waiting for. When a driver needs a
