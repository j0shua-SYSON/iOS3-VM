/*
 * VICADDRESS (0xF00) read — the PL192 vectored-dispatch entry point.
 *
 * AppleARMPL192VIC's interrupt handler does NOT read IRQSTATUS to find the
 * pending source. It reads VICADDRESS, and decodes the returned word as a
 * global source number in bits[30:0] with bit 31 as a "valid" tag:
 *     source = ret & 0x7fffffff;  bit = ret & 0x1f
 * then dispatches through its vector table for that source. A read of 0 decodes
 * to source 0, which the driver treats as spurious: it acknowledges and returns
 * without clearing anything — so a real interrupt (the self-IPI on line 4) that
 * reads back as source 0 re-fires forever. That was the boot-stopping storm.
 *
 * On real hardware the returned value is VICVECTADDR[activeSource], which the
 * driver programmed as (source | 0x80000000). With priorities unprogrammed on
 * this platform, the active source is simply the lowest-numbered pending line.
 * base_source places this VIC in the daisy chain: 0 for VIC0, 32 for VIC1.
