/*
 * iOS3-VM — S5L8900 power-gate controller.
 *
 * This block is what stood between a booting kernel and a booting OS. Apple's
 * AppleS5L8900XPowerController::start writes the domains it wants gated and
 * then spins reading STATE until it agrees:
 *
 *     write(OFFCTRL, 0x12fc);
 *     do { s = read(STATE); } while ((s & 0x12fc) != 0x12fc);
 *
 * With the window unmodelled, STATE read 0 forever: 3,887,707 reads, about a
 * quarter of a 200M-instruction boot, and start() never returned — so the
 * controller never registered and nothing downstream could power-gate anything.
 *
 * A storage stub cannot fix this, which is the whole reason this is a device
 * model rather than a stub: STATE is never written by the guest, so "return the
 * last value written" returns zero just as forever. The behaviour that matters
 * is the coupling — ONCTRL and OFFCTRL are the only things that move STATE.
 *
 * Polarity is taken from the driver's own generic gate routine, not guessed:
 *   power up:   write(ONCTRL,  1<<n); wait until STATE bit n is CLEAR
 *   power down: write(OFFCTRL, 1<<n); wait until STATE bit n is SET
 * so a set bit means "this domain is gated off". Nothing here self-clears and
 * nothing toggles on its own; STATE moves only in response to those two writes.
 *
 * The upper half of the page (0x80 and above) is a different block entirely —
 * the GPIO interrupt controller — and is deliberately not handled here.
