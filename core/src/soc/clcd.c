/*
 * iOS3-VM — S5L8900 CLCD display controller (AppleH1CLCD's hardware).
 *
 * This is the block between a booting kernel and a screen. Nothing here is
 * guessed from a datasheet — no S5L8900 documentation exists — every offset and
 * every bit below is a line of AppleH1CLCD's own ARM code, read out of the
 * AppleH1DisplayDrivers kext inside the shipped kernelcache (text at
 * 0xc0703000, size 0xa000). The driver keeps its mapped register base in
 * `this+0x1fc`, so any `ldr/str [rX, #off]` after `ldr rX,[this,#0x1fc]` is a
 * register access and the offset is directly readable. Addresses in the notes
 * below are virtual addresses in that kext, so each claim can be re-checked.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A DEVICE MODEL AND NOT A STUB
 *
 * Because one bit has to move on its own. AppleH1CLCD submits a framebuffer
 * swap and then waits for the controller to tell it the frame went out:
 *
 *   0xc0705d38  swap_submit tail
 *       if (shadowMask & 1) return;            // a swap is already pending
 *       write32(reg + 0x18, 1);                // clear any stale frame status
 *       shadowMask |= 1;
 *       write32(reg + 0x14, shadowMask);       // enable the frame interrupt
 *
 *   0xc0705d7c  the interrupt handler
 *       status  = read32(reg + 0x18);
 *       pending = status & shadowMask;
 *       if (pending & 1) {
 *           write32(reg + 0x18, 1);            // acknowledge, write-1-to-clear
 *           ... complete the swap, then if nothing else is queued:
 *           shadowMask &= ~1;
 *           write32(reg + 0x14, shadowMask);
 *       }
 *       if (pending & 0x3f00) {
 *           IOLog("AppleH1CLCD: Graphics underrun interrupt: %08x", pending);
 *           write32(reg + 0x18, 0x3f00);
 *       }
 *
 * Storage that returns what was last written would return 0 from 0x018 forever
 * and the swap would never complete: the UI wedges, permanently, with no error.
 * So this model raises the frame interrupt on a timer, in GUEST time.
 *
 * Two properties of that handler are load-bearing and are pinned by tests:
 *
 *   1. The interrupt LINE must be gated by the hardware mask at 0x014, not just
 *      by the status at 0x018. The handler masks the status with its own
 *      software shadow; if the line were asserted while the shadow's bit 0 is
 *      clear, `pending` would come out 0, the handler would acknowledge
 *      nothing, and it would re-enter forever. That is an interrupt storm, not
 *      a display. (This is the same failure shape as the timer's ack mask.)
 *
 *   2. We must NEVER set the underrun bits 0x3f00. There is no underrun in an
 *      emulator with no real FIFO, and setting them only produces error spam
 *      from a driver that is working correctly.
 *
 * WHAT THE DRIVER DOES, in the order it does it
 *
 *   start_hardware      0xc07059d8
 *       write32(reg + 0x218, 1);
 *       shadowMask = 0x3f00;                   // underruns only, for now
 *       write32(reg + 0x18, 0);                // 0x0d8..0x0ec are NOT touched
 *       write32(reg + 0x14, 0);
 *       write32(reg + 0x1c, 0);
 *       v = read32(reg + 8);
 *       v = (v & ~0x30000001) | 1;
 *       v = (v & ~0x02000000) | 0x01000000;
 *       v = (v & ~0x00330000) | 0x00110000;
 *       write32(reg + 8, v);
 *       write32(reg + 0xc, read32(reg + 0xc) | 0x000f0f0f);
 *
 *   enable path         0xc0705840
 *       write32(reg + 0x20, 1);
 *       write32(reg + 0x14, shadowMask);
 *       ... restore panel timing, then program the windows ...
 *       write32(reg + 0x00, 1);                // scanout starts HERE, last
 *       write32(reg + 0x200, read32(reg + 0x200) | 1);
 *
 *   stop  0xc0705694 / 0xc0705910
 *       shadowMask = 0; write32(reg+0x18, 0); write32(reg+0x14, 0);
 *       write32(reg+0x1c, 0); write32(reg+4, 1);
 *       write32(reg + 0x200, read32(reg + 0x200) & ~1);
 *
 *   window update       0xc0704940
 *       write32(reg + 0xd4, 2);
 *       write32(reg + 0xe8, 0x50001000);
 *       ... then the six registers of each enabled window ...
 *
 * REGISTER SEMANTICS, LABELLED
 *
 *   CONFIRMED (read directly out of the driver's code, cited above):
 *     0x000 start, 0x004 stop, 0x008 display+window enables and the exact
 *     read-modify-write masks, 0x00c FIFO thresholds OR 0x000f0f0f,
 *     0x014 interrupt enable, 0x018 interrupt status write-1-to-clear with
 *     bit 0 = frame and 0x3f00 = underrun, 0x01c cleared on start and stop,
 *     0x020 written 1 just before 0x000, 0x0d4 = 2 per update,
 *     0x0e8 = 0x50001000 per update, 0x200 bit 0 gate,
 *     0x204 read-only status used as `if (((v >> 6) & 3) == 3) defer the swap`
 *     (0xc0705ccc..0xc0705ce0), and the register at 0x218 written 1 at start.
 *     Base 0x38900000 and interrupt line 13 are confirmed from the device tree.
 *
 *   CORRECTED REGISTER LABELS: 0x0d8/0x0dc, 0x0e0/0x0e4 and 0x0e8/0x0ec
 *     are per-window configuration pairs in openiBoot, not panel timings.
 *     AppleH1CLCD also uses 0x0e8 as its update word. The real clock/timing
 *     handoff is VIDCON0/1 and VIDTCON0..3 at 0x200..0x218. The N82 values
 *     planted by s5l_clcd_seed_window0() follow openiBoot's optC and its
 *     recorded divisor-five iPhone 3G handoff (10.8 MHz pixels, inverted
 *     VCLK, 15/15/16 horizontal and 4/4/4 vertical porch/sync).
 *
 *   INFERRED: 0x024 backdrop colour, the 11 video-overlay registers at
 *     0x028..0x054, the 8 colour-matrix registers at 0x1c8..0x1e8, the opaque
 *     registers at 0x208..0x214 and the three gamma LUTs at 0x400/0x800/0xc00
 *     are all write-then-save/restore as far as the driver is concerned. Their
 *     MEANING is inferred from the surrounding code; their BEHAVIOUR (plain
 *     storage) is what the driver actually requires, and that much is certain.
 *
 *   CONFIRMED (was INFERRED): the layout of the RGB window registers at
 *     0x058 + k*0x18, now read out of 0xc0705f00 — the vtable slot
 *     IOMobileFramebuffer::start invokes immediately after start_hardware, and
 *     the most important function in this whole driver:
 *
 *       r2 = regs;
 *       if      (read32(r2+0x08) & 0x40) { pitch=[r2+0x58]; ctl=[r2+0x5c]; fb=[r2+0x60]; geom=[r2+0x64]; }
 *       else if (                & 0x20) { ...0x70 0x74 0x78 0x7c }
 *       else if (                & 0x10) { ...0x88 0x8c 0x90 0x94 }
 *       else if (                & 0x08) { ...0xa0 0xa4 0xa8 0xac }
 *       fourcc = ((ctl >> 8) & 7) >= 6 ? 'ARGB' : '565L';      // 0xc0705ff8
 *       width  = (geom << 5) >> 21;                            // bits[26:16]
 *       height = uxth(geom &~ 0xfc00);                         // bits[9:0]
 *       size   = round_up(pitch * height, 0x1000);
 *       md     = IOMemoryDescriptor::withPhysicalAddress(fb, size, kIODirectionOutIn);
 *       surface = IOCoreSurfaceRoot->createSurface(md, {IOSurfaceIsGlobal:true});
 *
 *     So the window base offsets, the CLCD_CTRL enable bits and their priority
 *     order, the field order, the geometry bit positions, and the fact that
 *     FBADDR is PHYSICAL are all facts now, not readings.
 *
 *     THE CONSEQUENCE IS THE POINT: AppleH1CLCD does not program the display.
 *     It reads whatever iBoot left in these registers and wraps it in the
 *     IOSurface that becomes the screen. If CLCD_CTRL enables no window, the
 *     four `ldrne`s above simply do not execute and the driver builds that
 *     IOSurface out of four uninitialised callee-saved registers. A boot stub
 *     standing in for iBoot MUST call s5l_clcd_seed_window0() — an unseeded
 *     controller is not a blank screen, it is a garbage surface.
 *
 *   STILL INFERRED, and deliberately not acted on: component order in control
 *     bits[17:16]. The driver publishes 'ARGB' whatever those bits hold, so we
 *     have no evidence for what they select. s5l_clcd_window() reports the
 *     field; s5l_clcd_scanout() ignores it rather than inventing a swizzle.
 *
 *   DECIDED, and stated: VIDCON1 preserves the N82 IVCLK polarity bit when the
 *     N82 display-clock handoff is present. Bits [7:6] are the only live-state
 *     bits AppleH1CLCD examines and it defers a swap when both are set. We keep
 *     those bits clear ("not busy") because no scanline engine exists to move
 *     them; inventing 0xc0 would deadlock every swap.
 *
 *   NOT MODELLED, deliberately: the hardware scanout does not read the
 *     framebuffer on its own, gamma is not applied, the video overlay does
 *     nothing, and 0x004 stops the frame interrupt but nothing else. None of
 *     that is invented behaviour — it is absent behaviour.
 *
 *     s5l_clcd_scanout() is the seam the header used to promise: it takes the
 *     window the DRIVER would take (s5l_clcd_active_window(), in the driver's
 *     own 0x40/0x20/0x10/0x08 order) and turns it into RGB. It is a host-side
 *     observation of guest memory, not a device behaviour: nothing the guest
 *     can see changes when it is called, and every byte it returns came out of
 *     guest DRAM. A window it cannot decode is an error return, never a
 *     plausible-looking rectangle.
