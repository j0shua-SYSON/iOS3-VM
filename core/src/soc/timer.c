/*
 * iOS3-VM — S5L8900 timer block.
 *
 * Two independent things live here, and conflating them is the mistake that
 * kept this kernel silent:
 *
 *   1. A free-running 64-bit counter at 0x080/0x084. This is the backing store
 *      for mach_absolute_time(). It counts unconditionally. If it reads zero
 *      forever, every delay loop and every timeout in the kernel waits forever,
 *      and the boot dies quietly in a spin lock rather than with a panic.
 *
 *   2. Timer 4, a down-counter the kernel arms as its decrementer to get a
 *      periodic FIQ. On expiry it latches TIMER4_IRQ_BITS, which is exactly
 *      the mask the kernel's own FIQ handler writes back to acknowledge.
 *
 * The register semantics below are inferred from what the real xnu-1357 kernel
 * does with this block, not from a datasheet — no public S5L8900 documentation
 * exists. Where behaviour is unobserved it is left inert rather than invented.
