# iOS3-VM

### Boot **real iPhone OS 3** — Apple's actual kernel, `launchd`, and SpringBoard — inside an app on a modern, jailbroken iPhone.

*A from-scratch, full-system emulator of the 2007 iPhone's silicon, running in 2025's pocket.*

## What is this?

iOS3-VM is a **low-level, full-system emulator**. It doesn't *reimplement* iPhone
OS or fake its apps — it emulates the **hardware** of the original iPhone's chip
(the Samsung **S5L8900** and its ARMv6 core) precisely enough that Apple's own
**unmodified** boot ROM → iBoot → XNU kernel → `launchd` → **SpringBoard** run on
top of it, believing they're on a real 2009 iPhone.

Then it puts that whole emulated phone **inside an app on your real iPhone.**

> **The honest headline:** *no open-source emulator has ever booted iPhone OS 3.x
> to a home screen.* The closest prior art boots iPhone OS 1.1 and 2.1.1 on an
> emulated iPod touch. Booting **3.x**, targeting a real **iPhone's** SoC, is
> unclaimed ground. That's the whole point.

## Why it's different

|  | Game/app emulators | UTM (QEMU-in-app) | **iOS3-VM** |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Runs a **real Apple OS** | ✗ | ✗ (Linux/Windows guests) | ✓ **(iPhone OS 3)** |
| **Full-system** (boots the actual kernel) | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Targets a **real iPhone's** silicon | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (S5L8900) |
| **From scratch**, dependency-free core | — | ✗ (QEMU + glib + …) | ✓ (portable C11) |
| Runs on a **jailbroken iPhone** | some | ✓ | ✓ |

## Status

This project is built **milestone by milestone — every stage boots something you
can see.** No months in the dark.

| | Milestone | State |
|---|---|---|
| **M0** | Toolchain online: core builds + tests in CI, iOS `.ipa` builds on a macOS runner, on-device self-test runs ARM code | ✅ **done** |
| **M1** | Complete ARMv6 (ARM1176) interpreter, unit-tested | 🔵 in progress — *70 CPU tests passing* |
| **M2** | S5L8900 bring-up: bare-metal payload prints over emulated UART | 🔵 **guest code prints; timer IRQs reach a handler** — MMU, bus, UART, VIC, timer · *17 SoC tests* |
| **M3** | IMG3 + NAND/NOR: Apple's real **iBoot** runs | ⚪ |
| **M4** | The real **XNU kernel** boots and logs | ⚪ |
| **M5** | `launchd` → **SpringBoard** renders — tap it 🏆 | ⚪ |

## How it works

```
   Windows dev box                GitHub Actions                 iPhone 6s Plus
  ┌────────────────┐   git push  ┌──────────────────┐  .ipa    ┌──────────────┐
  │ portable C core│ ──────────► │ macOS runner:    │ ───────► │ jailbroken   │
  │ tested locally │             │ xcodebuild →     │          │ iOS 15 · A9  │
  │ (MinGW, no SDK)│             │ ldid fake-sign   │          │ RWX JIT-ready│
  └────────────────┘             └──────────────────┘          └──────────────┘
```

The **emulator core is plain C11 with zero dependencies**, so it unit-tests in
under a second on any desktop — and drops unchanged into the iOS app. The only
Apple-specific code is the UIKit/Metal shell. See
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

**Why an old phone is the *ideal* host:** the A9 is `arm64` but predates Apple's
APRR JIT hardening (A11) and PAC/PPL (A12), so once the jailbreak relaxes
code-signing we get plain **RWX** pages from a bare `mmap` — the cleanest
possible home for a dynamic recompiler. The guests ran on a 412 MHz single core with 128 MB of RAM;
the host is a dual ~1.85 GHz `arm64` with 2 GB. Realtime is a real goal.

## Build & run

You need **nothing Apple** on your own machine — CI does the Apple build.

**Test the core locally** (any OS with a C compiler + CMake):
```sh
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

**Get the app:** push to GitHub → the `ios-build` workflow produces an unsigned,
fake-signed `iOS3VM.ipa` artifact. Install it on your jailbroken device running
**AppSync Unified** (which lets `installd` accept the `ldid` ad-hoc-signed IPA)
via Filza or any package installer — or, on a supported device, with
**TrollStore** (which permanently re-signs it through the CoreTrust bug, no
AppSync needed). Either way, no Apple Developer account is required.

**Boot an OS** (from M3 on): drop your **own** iPhone OS 3.1.3 IPSW and its
(publicly documented) decryption keys into the app's firmware folder — see
[`docs/BOOT_CHAIN.md`](docs/BOOT_CHAIN.md).

## Requirements

- **Host:** a **jailbroken** iPhone 6s / 6s Plus (Apple A9) on iOS 15. Dopamine
  2.x (A9 support) or palera1n both work; the jailbreak's "Allow JIT in apps"
  is what unlocks the dynarec.
- **Firmware:** your own iPhone OS 3.1.3 image + keys. **None is bundled** — this
  repo contains no Apple code, exactly like a console emulator ships no ROMs.
